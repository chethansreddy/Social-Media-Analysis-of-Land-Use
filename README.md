# Social-Media-Analysis-of-Land-Use
Geo-tagged tweets can potentially help with ‘sensing’ the interaction of people with their surrounding environment. Based on this hypothesis, this project makes use of geotagged tweets in order to ascertain various land uses with a broader goal to help with proper planning of city/area. The implemented method utilises supervised learning to reveal spatial land use within cities with the help of Twitter activity signatures. Specifically, the technique involves using tweets from Delhi. I tried to show that geo-tagged tweets contain features that can be useful for land use identification.

Data Set: 
The data used is scraped from twitter using Tweepy, a python library for accessing the Twitter API. It has 197802 tweets from different users from Delhi. The data set is called tweets_bowl.
